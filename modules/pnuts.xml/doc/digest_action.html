a List object and adds it to the object on the stack top, in a way that
depends on the type of the object.
<ul>
<li>If a List object is on the stack top, the created object is added to the List object.
<li>If a Map object is on the stack top, a map entry of {<em>keyword</em> => the created object} is added to the Map object.
<li>Otherwise,  this action assigns the created object to the Bean
property whose name is the <em>keyword</em>.  In this case, the Bean property must be of java.util.List type.

the following rules.

<ul>
<li>If the content of the element is not empty, the content is added to the List object.
<li>If the element has one or more child-elements, the values produced
by those elements are added to the List object.
<li>If the element has one or more attributes, a Map object of
{attribute's name => the value} is created and added to the List object.
