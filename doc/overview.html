    <h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>
This Pnuts User's Guide describes basic usage of Pnuts environment.  Readers will learn what kind of functions are available and how to integrate Pnuts into Java applications.
</p>
<p>
This section explains some prerequisites to read the rest of the guide.
</p>

<h3>Runtime Environment</h3>

<p>Pnuts runs on JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
version 1.2 or higher. The Pnuts distribution
does not include JRE, which means that you
need to install a JRE (or JDK) on your computer
before using Pnuts. If you have two or more
JREs installed, you can pick one to use Pnuts
every time you start a Pnuts interpreter
by setting environment variable PATH.<p>In addition to JRE, <tt>pnuts.jar</tt> file is required to run the Pnuts interpreter.
The <tt>pnuts.jar</tt> contains classes of Pnuts API which
are used to implement the <tt>pnuts</tt> command, in addition, developers can call them directly to incorporate the Pnuts' functionality into their applications.
</p>


<h3>Functions</h3>
<p>
Pnuts functions fall into two categories: built-in functions and others.
It is important to distinguish them.  Built-in functions are guaranteed to be
      available even if no module or script is loaded. <a href="lang.html#builtin">The Language
	Specification</a> defines the built-in functions.  
</p>
<H3>Modules</H3>
<P>Module is a set of reusable functions which
are used for a particular purpose, or are
interrelated. User can choose necessary modules
at run time, so that he/she can take advantage
of existing modules without worrying about name confliction.
Each module is packaged as a separate JAR file,
which should be added to <em>CLASSPATH</em> or located in
the directory <tt>${PNUTS_HOME}/modules/</tt>.
</P>

<P>Several modules are included in the Pnuts
distribution. By default, a couple of general-purpose
modules are chosen when Pnuts interpreter
starts. User can specify the startup module
in the environment variable(PNUTS_MODULE).
See &quot;<A href="module.html">Modules</A>&quot; for more information of each module.
