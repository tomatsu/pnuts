<h2>GUI Environment</h2>

<a name="console"></a>
<h3>pnuts -w</h3>

<div class="box">
<div class="synopsis">
<code>C:\> pnuts -w</code>
</div>
</div>
<p>
When <tt>-w</tt> option is given to the pnuts command, Swing-based GUI
console comes up.

<h3>Pnutool</h3>

<p> Pnutool is a GUI version of the Pnuts script interpreter, which is written
      entirely in the Pnuts script language.  Since the script language can call any public member of a Java class, a User can test any public call to see what happens using this tool.
</p>


<div class="box">
<div class="synopsis">
<code>C:\> pnuts -e pnutool()</code>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Pnutool has two TextAreas, a workspace area and an output area. The workspace area is where the User gives commands.  The output of the execution is printed in output area.
</p>

<p>
<em>Open</em> opens a local file and displays in the workspace area.  <em>Open URL</em> reads from specified URL and displays in the workspace area.  <em>Save</em> saves the contents of the workspace area into the specified local file.  <em>Load</em> loads a script from the local file system. 
</p>

<h4>Evaluating Scripts</h4>
<p>
<em>Eval</em> sends the User's input to interpreter. If some text in the workspace is selected, the selected text is sent as a command. If no text is selected the current line is sent as a command.
</p>

<p>
For example, input the following commands into the workspace and select all of the commands. Perform an evaluation, Eval(or type Ctrl-j).
</p>

<pre class="eg">
import("java.awt.*")
frame = Frame("test")
frame.setSize(100, 100)
frame.show()
</pre>

<p>
A Frame object will be created and displayed as the result.  Then to change the size of the window, edit the 2nd command as '<tt>frame.setSize(200, 200)</tt>' and select the command text by dragging the mouse cursor.
Select the Eval item again.  The window will become twice as large as before.
